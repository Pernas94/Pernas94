### Hello!🙋‍♂️ I'm Mauro, a backend developer looking for new professional challenges.

📲I am focused mainly in backend development, with more than 2 years of experience in enterprise projects. I've worked for 2 of Spain's biggest companies, in the electrical and the energetic fields, in both monolitical and microservices architectures. On a more 'amateur' level, I'm also into Android app development, and soon I'll get into iOS too.

💻I am proficient in Java, Spring, Oracle SQL and Kotlin. I also have strong knowledge of Python, HTML, CSS and JS, as well as some knowledge of C# and Firebase.

📌I am curious by nature, always looking for things to learn and projects to work in. In fact, my goal is always to grow and learn.

Looking to colaborate in any projects that can help me grow as a developer!🖥
