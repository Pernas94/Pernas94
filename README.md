### Hello!🙋‍♂️ I'm Mauro, a junior developer looking for new professional challenges.

📲I am focused mainly in native apps development with Kotlin/Java in Android Studio, but I am always open to learning new skills and working with new technologies. Backend developments are also one of my main interests.

💻I have experience working in group and individual projects. I've worked extensively with Java, Kotlin and C#, making desktop and mobile applications and even games with Unity. I am able to work with databases pretty effectively, both SQL (MySQL, SQLLite) and NoSQL (Firebase, MongoDB).

📌I am curious by nature, always looking for things to learn and projects to work in. In fact, to learn and contribute are the principles I live by.

Looking to colaborate in any projects that can help me grow as a developer!🖥
