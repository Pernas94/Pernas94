### Hello! I'm Mauro, a junior developer looking for new professional challenges.

I am focused mainly in native apps development with Kotlin/Java in Android Studio, but I am always open to learning new skills and working with new technologies. Backend developments are also one of my main interests.

I am curious by nature, always looking for things to learn and projects to work in. In fact, to learn and contribute are the principles I live by.

Looking to colaborate in any projects that can help me grow as a developer!
